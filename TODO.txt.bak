Fixed the login.  - Multi users could logon, now it give and error. :)
ok now.. when a client dc remove the 'user', 'name' from the self.clients{}

Get the client to join a server.


you usualy don't forward connections around.

your client connects to the lobby server.
the client asks the lobbyserver for a list of gameservers.
then the client picks one and connects to the game server (with a new connection).
when the game is over the client can disconnect from the gameserver.

you can stay connected to the lobby over the entire time.
